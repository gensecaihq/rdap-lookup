# Enhancements for RDAP Lookup Tool

This document outlines potential enhancements for the RDAP Lookup Tool, categorized into current and future improvements.

## Completed Enhancements

*   **Loading Indicators:** Added a loading spinner to the results section.
*   **Clearer Error Messages:** Improved error messages from the API.
*   **Input Validation:** Added client-side validation for the input field.
*   **Configuration:** Moved rate-limiting values to environment variables.
*   **Email Security Checks:** Added SPF and DMARC record lookups.
*   **DKIM Record Lookup:** Added an optional DKIM selector for domain lookups.
*   **SSL/TLS Certificate Checker:** Added an SSL/TLS certificate checker.
*   **RBL/DNSBL Checker:** Added a checker for IP addresses against RBLs.

## Future Enhancements (Long-term)

These are larger features that could be added to the application over time.

### 1. Frontend & UX

*   **Responsive Design:** While the layout is functional, further refinement for smaller screen sizes would be beneficial.
*   **Component Refactoring:** The `HomePage` component is getting large. Some parts, like the result display, could be extracted into their own components.

### 2. Backend & API

*   **Persistent Rate Limiting:** The current rate limiting is in-memory, which means it resets on server restart. Using a persistent store like Redis or a database would make the rate limiting more robust.
*   **Logging:** Implement logging to track API usage, errors, and performance. This would be invaluable for debugging and monitoring.

### 3. Code Quality & Maintainability

*   **Add Tests:** There are currently no tests. Adding unit tests for the API endpoint and component tests for the frontend would improve the reliability of the application.
*   **TypeScript:** Migrating the project to TypeScript would add static typing, which can help prevent bugs and improve developer experience.

### 4. Advanced Features

*   **Bulk Lookup:** Allow users to enter a list of domains, IPs, etc., to look up at once.
*   **Historical Data:** Store lookup results in a database to provide historical data for a given object.
*   **User Accounts:** Allow users to create accounts to manage their lookup history and get higher rate limits.
*   **API for Developers:** Expose the RDAP lookup functionality as a public API for other developers to use.

### 5. Integrations

*   **Geolocation:** For IP address lookups, integrate with a geolocation service to display the location of the IP.
*   **DNS Information:** For domain lookups, display related DNS information like A, MX, and NS records.

### 6. Deployment & Infrastructure

*   **Dockerize the Application:** Create a `Dockerfile` to make it easier to deploy the application in a containerized environment.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
